# SolarThing Android Privacy Policy

### Analytics Policy
SolarThing Android currently does not contain any analytics. This may change in a future update.

### "Location" Policy
SolarThing Android uses the location permission to view the WiFi network (SSID) that the user
is currently connected to. The name of the SSID does not leave your device. This optional feature
is used to change the active profile if the user configures it to do so. Depending on the active
profile and how the user configures the profile, SolarThing Android will connect to a different
IP address based on the current WiFi network.

Although the permission granted gives SolarThing the ability to use GPS sensors and other means
of getting exact user location, SolarThing does not and will not use this ability unless there
is an update in the future that decides these optional features could be used. If that happens
to be the case, SolarThing Android will not use these features without user consent.
